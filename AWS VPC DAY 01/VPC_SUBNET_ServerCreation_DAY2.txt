1.Decide what IP range we need to use : 10.1.0.0/16 (255.255.0.0)
2.Create a VPC and name it as TCS.enable DNS host names 
3.Create 3 subnets as below:
TCS_Subnet-1 10.1.1.0/24    us-east-1a
TCS_Subnet-1 10.1.2.0/24    us-east-1b
TCS_Subnet-1 10.1.3.0/24    us-east-1c

Once Subnets are created ,enable automatic Public IP assignment.
4.Create InternatGateway using NAme TCS-IGW and attach to VPC
5.Create a new routing table as tata-main-table and attach subnets to it.
6. Create a Route towards IGW
7.Create a security group and allow all ports
8.create a key pair
9.Deploy a new VM/instance/server and connect using key you created in step 8.
